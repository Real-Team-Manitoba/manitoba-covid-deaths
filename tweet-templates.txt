Cameron Friesen may no longer be health minister but we will never forget his share of Manitoba’s COVID-19 DEATHS deaths as of DATE.

New health minister Silver Spoon Stefanson has already failed to act and has a growing responsibility for the DEATHS COVID-19 deaths in Manitoba as of DATE.

Pandemic Pallister says “government can’t protect you from this virus” after having closed hospitals and ERs and now we have DEATHS dead in Manitoba 😡

Pallbearer Pallister says he can’t be racist because he grew up near reserves, but Indigenous people make up a disproportionate amount of the DEATHS dead in Manitoba because of his government’s genocidal approach to the pandemic: RACISM

Pandemic Pallister says people don’t like him because of restrictions, but many more hate him because there are DEATHS dead loved ones in Manitoba as of DATE thanks to his government’s devastating health care cuts and a wasted summer with no foreplanning.

There are DEATHS dead from COVID-19 in Manitoba as of DATE thanks to Pandemic Pallister’s failures.
